This is my custom project from the course Software Development for Mobile Devices. 

Weather Forecast is a weather forecasting app created using Kotlin programming language. The main functions of the app are 
showing weather detail and let the userstake notes for each day. One minor function of the app is to let users change the app's theme. 

The databases that the app using are Firebase Firestore: https://firebase.google.com/ 
and Room database: https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room. 
All the weather information are retrieved from OpenWeatherAPI: https://openweathermap.org/
